# Landon Hotel Booking Application
I completed this project during my 5th semester at WGU as a part of the class, Advanced Java D387.

For this project, I enhanced the Landon Hotel scheduling application to meet new requirements. 
I implemented localization and internationalization by building resource bundles for English and French, enabling the application to display a welcome message in both languages using multithreading. The front end was updated to show reservation prices in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, and euros. Additionally, I created a Java method for time zone conversion, allowing the application to display live presentation times in ET, MT, and UTC. To support deployment, I built and tested a Dockerfile that packaged the multithreaded Spring application and Angular front end into a containerized solution. I also outlined a cloud deployment strategy in document “C3.pdf”, selecting a provider and detailing the process.

For the complete project requirements, please refer to the “Task Description.pdf” file.
